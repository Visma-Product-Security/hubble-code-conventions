# .NET Coding Standards

This section contains all coding standards for .NET development.

## Table of Contents

- [Naming Conventions](./naming-conventions.md)
- [Code Structure and Layout](./code-structure.md)
- [Type Usage and Collections](./type-usage.md)
- [Formatting Rules](./formatting.md)
- [Error Handling](./error-handling.md)
- [Unit Testing](./testing.md)
- [Code Quality](./code-quality.md)

## General Principles

Our codebase should be consistent, maintainable, and follow modern .NET best practices. These conventions help ensure code readability and make onboarding new developers easier.

## Section Links

You can link to specific sections within documentation files using Markdown's anchor links. This is useful for referencing specific guidelines or rules:

- Link to a section within the same file: `[Link text](#section-name)`
- Link to a section in another file: `[Link text](./file-name.md#section-name)`

The section name in the anchor link should be the header text, lowercase, with spaces replaced by hyphens, and all punctuation removed.

### Examples

- Link to the "Variable Naming" section: `[Variable Naming](./naming-conventions.md#variable-naming)`
- Link to the "Braces" section: `[Braces](./code-structure.md#braces)`

You can also use this approach in Table of Contents to link to specific sections:

- [Error Handling - Exception Guidelines](./error-handling.md#exception-guidelines)
- [Code Quality - Code Analyzers](./code-quality.md#code-analyzers)

### Clickable Headers

Each header in the documentation has a clickable link icon that appears when you hover over it. Clicking this icon will:

1. Update the URL in your browser's address bar to include the section anchor
2. Copy this URL to your clipboard (if your browser supports it)

This makes it easy to share links to specific sections with your team.
